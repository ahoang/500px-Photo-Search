# 500px-Photo-Search

This is a Mac App that allows you to find photos on the 500px API using any search term. 
The results will display in an NSOutlineView, grouped by your search term. 
The UI will display a thumbnail of the photo along with the ISO, Aperture, and Shutterspeed used to take that photo.

I didn't have much time this week and wanted to turn this around quickly; this app follows MVVM architecture but without Reactive.
